# Rainfall Prediction with MLFlow

This project predicts rainfall based on weather conditions using machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training with Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation with metrics and confusion matrices
- MLFlow integration for experiment tracking

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chanupadeshan/Rainfall_Prediction_with_MLFlow.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Rainfall_Prediction_with_MLFlow
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
